***ANSWER ALL OF THE QUESTIONS BELOW***

Why do we need data structure?
Answer:Data structures are useful in storing and organizing the data in an efficient manner.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different data structures?
Answer:â€¢	Searching. Inserting. Deleting. Sorting. Merging.

When would we use data structures in the real world?
Answer:

What is an array?
Answer:An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed.


What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Answer:Array is a fixed length data structure whereas ArrayList is a variable length Collection class. We cannot change length of array once created in Java but ArrayList can be changed. We cannot store primitives in ArrayList, it can only store objects. But array can contain both primitives and objects in Java.


What is a LinkedList?
Answer:The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type, just like the ArrayList



How is an Array different from LinkedList?
Answer:An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. A linked list is a collection of objects known as a node where node consists of two parts, data and address. Array elements store in a contiguous memory location. Linked list elements can be stored anywhere in the memory or randomly stored.

What is a Queue?
Answer:Queue is a linear ordered data structure that follows FIFO (First In, First Out) ordering of elements. This means that the element inserted first in the queue will be the first element to be removed. The queue is implemented as an interface that inherits the Collection interface.



What is a Stack (referring to data structures)?
Answer:Stacks in Data Structures is a linear type of data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle and allows insertion and deletion operations from one end of the stack data structure, that is top
